<h2>Oudom Choun</h2>
<h2>Dom</h2>
<p>How's it going everyone. Let me introduce myself. My name is Oudom and I'm from Cambodia.</p>
<p>Currently, I am working for one company in Cambodia. Web and Computer 
    Programming is a degree that I study.</p>
<p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since 2013.
     One of my favorite quotes is from President Monson, said "Stick to your task 'til it sticks to you; beginners are many, 
     but enders are few". And my favorite scripture is in Alma 26:36.</p>
<p>I am enjoy listening to music, Conference talks, reading scripture, 
    and hanging out with friends on the weekend.</p>
<p>I am happy to know y'all this semester.</p>
