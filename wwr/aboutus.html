                <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h3>
                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
                    the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
                    beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs 
                    from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
                    interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                    <br>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days<br>
                    <br>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.<br></p>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <h3>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall 
                    (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be 
                    bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are 
                    some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things 
                    very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</p>
                <h3>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h3>
                <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness 
                    First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                    Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips 
                    and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>

                <h3>Next Summer booking open now!</h3>
                <p>Make sure to reserve your date now, we have limited runs on each river and they go fast. If you have only certain dates that you can get away you should book now.</p>
                <h3>Highlights from the past season</h3>
                <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon 
                    introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. The season started off with 
                    some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared 
                    reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.</p>
